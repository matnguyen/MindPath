# MindPath - An Interactive Exploratory Resources Hub

Our project is designed to assist first responders, which include: professional police officers, emergency responders, and firefighters. We take an evidence-based approach towards mental health. 

Our main targets are those in the age range of 25-45 as this is the largest age group

By having an online resource hub that is customizable, it would help connect the user to a more condensed and selected list of services catered to their specific needs.

Visually representing other active users in real-time creates a feeling of being a part of a larger community which will encourage feelings of inclusion for the user. 

Enveloping the user in an active community helps alleviate some of the intimidation associated with seeking for help. 

Implemented in python and django. Web application, with possible AI implementation.

## Implementation:
* Back end: Django (Python)
* Front end: Javascript, HTML, CSS
